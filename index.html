              <p>
                I am a research assistant at the
                <a href="https://power.knust.edu/">Power Systems Laboratory</a>
                at the Department of Electrical / Electronic Engineering of the
                <a href="https://knust.edu.gh/"
                  >Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology</a
                >. Under the guidance of
                <a
                  href="https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/publications/453765c2283e.html"
                  >Prof. Emmanuel Frimpong</a
                >, I completed my Bachelor's degree in the College of
                Engineering at the same university in November 2023. I worked as
                a teaching assistant there during that time as well. Before
                joining the department as a teaching assistant, I undertook my
                national service as a research assistant at the Information
                Security and Technology Department at
                <a href="https://uits.knust.edu.gh">UITS</a>. I aided in the
                establishment of a Security Operating Center for the University
                and served as a Trainee SOC analyst for the latter half of my
                stay. Between June and September 2023, I also earned several
                relevant cybersecurity certifications with help from UITS,
                including
                <a

                >
                  Google Cybersecurity Certificate</a
                >. From September 2023, I joined the K.N.U.S.T Power Systems
                laboratory to research applications of computational techniques
                in power systems. My ultimate ambition is to establish a
                pioneering research institute in Ghana. I aim to build an
                institution that drives scientific progress, empowers local
                talents, and addresses pressing challenges faced by the nation
                and the African continent.

            <h3><a id="research">Research Interests</a></h3>
            <p>
              I am interested in maximizing the potential of artificial
              intelligence in power networks, especially as the smart grid era
              beckons. My interests encompass various facets of power systems,
              including protection, cybersecurity, automation, control,
              planning, and optimization. As I continue researching, I aim to
              expand my focus to networked and multi-agent systems, addressing
              broader optimization and grid resilience challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research interests fall into four (4) macro-areas of Electrical
              and Computer Engineering:
